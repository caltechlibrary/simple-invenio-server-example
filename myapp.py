# actually add the record when this file is executed by Flask; it only
# defines a command that we have to call separately from the outside.
#
# I've tried many ways to put this into a separate file or to run it here
# without using the Flask fixture mechanism, but failed. Running the code
# here (even inside an app context or test app context) fails with errors
# that I don't fully understand; conversely, putting this fixture code in a
# separate file seems to be hard because there's no way to tell flask they're
# in a separate file, which means *this* file has to import the fixtures
# file, which leads to circular imports, and anyway, where's the modularity
# in that?  So I'm leaving it here.
